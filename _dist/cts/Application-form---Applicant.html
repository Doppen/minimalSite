    The Code of Ethics of NACID’s Employees sets out explicit norms regarding the confidentiality of the work of NACID employees, which includes the administration of the national repository. All information and documentation available to NACID is for official work-related use only and its use for personal purposes is forbidden. Employees may not disclose information, disclose professional secrets, or provide documents that belong to NACID, provide statements about their official duties or obligations to third parties or the media. Exceptions from this rule are regulated by the law. NACID has the right to take all actions necessary under the national legislation against employees who have copied or otherwise acquired official information in breach of the Code of Ethics or other relevant legislation.
    
    Depositors and users
    In order to ensure the security of the information in the repository and to prevent the misuse of user data, the registered users are obliged to keep the confidentiality of their login details and not disclose it to third parties. NACID processes personal data in view of the functioning of the Portal and the repository in the interest of the national research community and the public at large in compliance with the privacy policy of BPOS (https://bpos.bg/en/privacy-policy ). Details about the registration process can be found in R7.
    
    The Depositor acknowledges during submission that if he is publishing scientific resources that contain personal data and / or other sensitive information, he/she acts in compliance with national and European legislation in the field of personal data, including that he/she has taken the necessary data protection measures. The Depositor also declares that the processing of personal data does not exceed the initial purpose for what the data was collected and/or the archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. (https://bpos.bg/assets/documents/Deposit%20agreement_ENG.pdf )
    The Depositor is required take measures to minimize the processing of personal data and pseudonymise it where possible. Given that the mission of the repository is to make research publications widely available, confidential data or data with disclosure risk is out of the scope of the repository. To date the repository has no submissions containing confidential data or data with disclosure risk which cannot be anonymized, and we do not expect this to change in the future.
    The submissions are reviewed by a moderator from the organization the scientist is affiliated to. If the moderators are in doubt about the compliance of the dataset with applicable laws or regulations, they can request more information from the Depositor or refuse to publish the submission. (art. 15 Instructions on publishing of scientific resources in the national repository https://bpos.bg/assets/documents/Instructions%20on%20publishing.pdf ). The review process will be discussed in detail in R8 and R11.
    If there are any special conditions they can be addressed in a distribution license tailored by the Depositor specifically for the particular item. Also the depositor can indicate different access rights – restricted access, metadata access only. (art. 6 https://bpos.bg/assets/documents/Instructions%20on%20publishing.pdf ). Most of our publications are with open access and distributed under similar public licenses, in particular variants of the Creative Commons licenses. Substantially less data is available under custom licenses.
    
    The Depositors declares that the uploading/publishing of the scientific resource is in accordance with Bulgarian, EU and international legislation, including that uploading/publishing the resource does not infringe upon the intellectual property and/or related rights of third parties.
    
    In case there is proof or significant evidence of a violation of the terms of use or any other legal provisions, NACID reserves the right to delete or remove from public view the relevant content. (https://bpos.bg/en/terms-and-conditions )

It is therefore of vital importance to the entire application that detailed responses are given to each question. Please select from among the options and provide details for the items that appear in the Context Requirement.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Repository Type. This item will help reviewers understand what function your repository performs. Choose the best match for your repository type (select all that apply). If none of the categories is appropriate, feel free to provide another descriptive type. You may also provide further details to help the reviewer understand your repository type.</li>
      <li>Brief Description of Repository. Provide a short overview of the repository; in particular, please add information on the type of data accepted by the repository (i.e., the scope of its collection). If the repository has outsource partners, is part of a network, or of a parent organization, the response should ideally include a diagram and description of the overarching organizational structure.</li>
      <li>Designated Community. A clear definition of the Designated Community demonstrates that the applicant understands the scope, knowledge base, and methodologies—including preferred software/formats—of the user community or communities they are targeting. Please make sure that the response is sufficiently specific to enable reviewers to assess the adequacy of the curation and preservation measures described throughout the application.</li>
      <li>Level of Curation. This item is intended to elicit whether the repository distributes its content to data consumers without any changes, or whether the repository adds value by enhancing the content in some way. All levels of curation assume initial deposits are retained unchanged and that edits are only made on copies of those originals. Annotations/edits must fall within the terms of the license agreed with the data producer and be clearly within the skillset of those undertaking the curation. Thus, the repository will be expected to demonstrate that any such annotations/edits are undertaken and documented by appropriate experts and that the integrity of all original copies is maintained. Knowing this will help reviewers in assessing other certification Requirements. Further details can be added that would help to understand the levels of curation you undertake.</li>
      <li>Insource/Outsource Partners. Please provide a list of Partners that your organization works with, describing the nature of the relationship (organizational, contractual, etc.), and whether the Partner has undertaken any trustworthy repository assessment. If a function or supporting evidence is not under the direct control of the applicant then it falls into this category. This may be with a host organization or other ‘insourcing’ relationship, or through outsourcing or other dependency on a third-party. Such relationships may include, but are not limited to: any services provided by an institution you are part of, storage provided by others as part of multicopy redundancy, or membership in organizations that may undertake stewardship of your data collection when a business continuity issue arises. Moreover, please list the certification requirements for which the Partner provides all, or part of, the relevant functionality/service, including any contracts or Service Level Agreements in place. Because outsourcing will almost always be partial, you will still need to provide appropriate evidence for certification Requirements that are not outsourced and for the parts of the data lifecycle that you control. Qualifications/certifications—including, but not limited to, the CoreTrustSeal certification (and its predecessors)—are preferred for outsource partners. However, it is not a necessity for them to be certified. We understand that this can be a complex area to define and describe, but such details are essential to ensure a comprehensive review process.</li>
      <li>Summary of Significant Changes Since Last Application. CoreTrustSeal certification has an expectation of continuous improvement. Repositories undergoing recertification should highlight briefly to the reviewers any significant changes in technical systems, Designated Community, funding, and so on during the previous three years. In doing so, please refer to any comments given to you by the reviewers of your previous CoreTrustSeal application. Detailed information on a change should be added to the appropriate Requirement.</li>
      <li>Other Relevant Information. The repository may wish to add extra contextual information that is not covered in the Requirements but that may be helpful to the reviewers in making their assessment. For example, you might describe:
        <ul>
          <li>The usage and impact of the repository data holdings (citations, use by other projects, etc.).</li>
          <li>A national, regional, or global role that the repository serves.</li>
          <li>Any global cluster or network organization that the repository belongs to.</li>
        </ul>
    
      </li>
    </ol>

    The new evidence makes the process much clearer and proves a structured approach on preservation planning. Planned activities to improve and automate the process and use Archivematica as a digital preservation system are convincing. You may consider file format validation (if applicable) in your longer-term plan, which isn’t mentioned there yet.</p>

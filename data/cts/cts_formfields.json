However, these lists are neither exhaustive nor prescriptive. It is therefore highly preferred that responses are written in full prose. While short subtitles may be used, applicants should refrain from writing out the entire text given in each bullet point. \n\n● The CoreTrustSeal Board—and by extension, the CoreTrustSeal Secretariat and any designated reviewers—will treat all application responses, linked evidence, and compliance levels as sensitive during the certification process. Once the CoreTrustSeal for Data Repositories is awarded, the final version of the application, containing both the above information and reviewers’ comments, will be made publically available via the CoreTrustSeal Application Management Tool. The CoreTrustSeal Board will handle all information provided with the utmost care, but accepts no liability for any damage or losses resulting from the use of this information. \n\n● By requesting feedback, simple queries concerning your application may be directed to the CoreTrustSeal Secretariat. By submitting for review, your application will undergo formal assessment by two external reviewers, and will be subject to an administration fee of 1000 EUR (covering a three-year certification). The review process will begin only upon receipt of this fee. \n\n● Once awarded, the CoreTrustSeal for Data Repositories is applicable to one website of the certified repository only, and its location agreed upon in advance with the CoreTrustSeal Board. \n\nPlease also see the Extended Guidance for further details on the preferred structure and content for submissions, including use of acronyms, references to evidence, and so on: https://www.coretrustseal.org/why-certification/requirements/",

    "options": "The repository should analyze potential threats, assess risks, and create a consistent security system. It should describe damage scenarios based on malicious actions, human error, or technical failure that pose a threat to the repository and its data, products, services, and users. It should measure the likelihood and impact of such scenarios, decide which risk levels are acceptable, and determine which measures should be taken to counter the threats to the repository and its Designated Community. This should be an ongoing process. \n\nFor this Requirement, please describe: \n\n● Your IT security system, employees with roles related to security (e.g., security officers), and any risk analysis tools (e.g., DRAMBORA*) you use. \n\n● What levels of security are required, and how these are supported. \n\n● Any authentication and authorization procedures employed to securely manage access to systems in use (e.g., Shibboleth, OpenAthens). \n\nThe storage processes and technical infrastructure that utilize these security measures should be covered in R9 (Documented storage procedures) and R15 (Technical Infrastructure), respectively. \n\n* https://www.repositoryaudit.eu/",

The new evidence makes the process much clearer and proves a structured approach on preservation planning. Planned activities to improve and automate the process and use Archivematica as a digital preservation system are convincing. You may consider file format validation (if applicable) in your longer-term plan, which isn’t mentioned there yet.</p>

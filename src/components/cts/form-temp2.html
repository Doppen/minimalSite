<p>The Research Data Support function of Information Services, University of Edinburgh, was brought together from two teams – one in EDINA and one in Library & University Collections – in 2018. This was a rationalisation in part because of the logic of operating the institutional data repository from the academic library, in keeping with peer institutions. The Edinburgh University Library dates back to 1580, three years before the founding of the University (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_University_Library) and is particularly proud of its archival holdings and special collections, preserved over centuries (https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/crc/collections/archives), and more recently of its digital collections and digital preservation abilities, managed by the Digital Library team.</p>

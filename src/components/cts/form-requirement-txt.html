NACID employees
The Code of Ethics of NACID’s Employees sets out explicit norms regarding the confidentiality of the work of NACID employees, which includes the administration of the national repository. All information and documentation available to NACID is for official work-related use only and its use for personal purposes is forbidden. Employees may not disclose information, disclose professional secrets, or provide documents that belong to NACID, provide statements about their official duties or obligations to third parties or the media. Exceptions from this rule are regulated by the law. NACID has the right to take all actions necessary under the national legislation against employees who have copied or otherwise acquired official information in breach of the Code of Ethics or other relevant legislation.

Depositors and users
In order to ensure the security of the information in the repository and to prevent the misuse of user data, the registered users are obliged to keep the confidentiality of their login details and not disclose it to third parties. NACID processes personal data in view of the functioning of the Portal and the repository in the interest of the national research community and the public at large in compliance with the privacy policy of BPOS (https://bpos.bg/en/privacy-policy ). Details about the registration process can be found in R7.

The Depositor acknowledges during submission that if he is publishing scientific resources that contain personal data and / or other sensitive information, he/she acts in compliance with national and European legislation in the field of personal data, including that he/she has taken the necessary data protection measures. The Depositor also declares that the processing of personal data does not exceed the initial purpose for what the data was collected and/or the archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. (https://bpos.bg/assets/documents/Deposit%20agreement_ENG.pdf )
The Depositor is required take measures to minimize the processing of personal data and pseudonymise it where possible. Given that the mission of the repository is to make research publications widely available, confidential data or data with disclosure risk is out of the scope of the repository. To date the repository has no submissions containing confidential data or data with disclosure risk which cannot be anonymized, and we do not expect this to change in the future.
The submissions are reviewed by a moderator from the organization the scientist is affiliated to. If the moderators are in doubt about the compliance of the dataset with applicable laws or regulations, they can request more information from the Depositor or refuse to publish the submission. (art. 15 Instructions on publishing of scientific resources in the national repository https://bpos.bg/assets/documents/Instructions%20on%20publishing.pdf ). The review process will be discussed in detail in R8 and R11.
If there are any special conditions they can be addressed in a distribution license tailored by the Depositor specifically for the particular item. Also the depositor can indicate different access rights – restricted access, metadata access only. (art. 6 https://bpos.bg/assets/documents/Instructions%20on%20publishing.pdf ). Most of our publications are with open access and distributed under similar public licenses, in particular variants of the Creative Commons licenses. Substantially less data is available under custom licenses.

The Depositors declares that the uploading/publishing of the scientific resource is in accordance with Bulgarian, EU and international legislation, including that uploading/publishing the resource does not infringe upon the intellectual property and/or related rights of third parties.

In case there is proof or significant evidence of a violation of the terms of use or any other legal provisions, NACID reserves the right to delete or remove from public view the relevant content. (https://bpos.bg/en/terms-and-conditions )
